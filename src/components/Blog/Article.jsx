        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          Every day, millions of businesses compete for visibility online,
          making it increasingly difficult to capture the attention of potential
          customers. Organic search results are highly sought after, but earning
          a top spot on Google takes time and consistent effort. Meanwhile, PPC
          ads promise instant visibility but can quickly drain your budget if
          not executed effectively.

        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          For small businesses with limited resources, this dilemma can feel
          like an impossible balancing act. Do you play the long game with
          organic strategies or opt for quick wins with PPC?

          Comparing PPC and Organic Marketing
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          Pay-per-click (PPC) and organic marketing each offer distinct
          advantages and challenges, making them effective for different
          business needs. PPC is designed to deliver immediate results by
          securing top placements on search engines or social media platforms,
          providing businesses with instant visibility.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          On the other hand, organic marketing focuses on building a strong,
          sustainable presence through strategies like search engine
          optimization (SEO) and content creation. This approach builds trust
          and credibility over time, delivering consistent traffic without the
          need for ongoing ad spend.
